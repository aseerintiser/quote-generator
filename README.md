# Quote Generator

This is random quote generator project.

In this project, I made an asynchronous fetch request to a REST API in order to get quotes.

There are two buttons.

First one is the 'New Quote' button.
If this is clicked, a random quote with its author name will be generated.
There is a loader between the quotes. The idea is that when it takes a long time to load, I want to signal to the user that something is happening behind the scenes.

The other button is the 'Twitter' button.
When we click on this, it will open a new tab, and if we are logged in, it will allow us to tweet.

This project is also mobile responsive as well.
